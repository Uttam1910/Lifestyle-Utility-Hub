### Project Summary

- **Multi‑page Structure:**  
  Separate pages for Home, Tools, Blog, Contact, About Us, and comprehensive legal pages ensure both clarity for users and compliance with legal standards.

- **Responsive Design & Navigation:**  
  A desktop header with a mobile‑friendly hamburger menu and a sticky footer (with sections for company info, navigation, and contact details) support a seamless user experience across devices.

- **Interactive Tools:**  
  The inclusion of a tip calculator, currency converter, BMI calculator, loan calculator, and retirement savings calculator—each using a consistent design approach—adds value and engagement.

- **SEO & Legal Compliance:**  
  Optimized meta tags, structured data (JSON‑LD for FAQs and breadcrumbs), and dedicated legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Cookie Policy) build trust with users and search engines.

- **Monetization Preparation:**  
  With reserved areas for Google AdSense and strategies for additional revenue streams (affiliate marketing, donations, etc.), the framework is in place for future growth.
